    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Prepare the cream filling:
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream with the powdered sugar and vanilla extract until soft peaks form. Set aside.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Prepare the berry filling:
            <ul>
                <li>Wash and dry the berries. If using strawberries, hull and slice them.</li>
                <li>If desired, drizzle the berries with honey or maple syrup and set aside.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Make the omelette mixture:
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, milk or cream, and a pinch of salt until well combined and slightly frothy.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Cook the omelette:
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the butter, swirling to coat the pan evenly.</li>
                <li>Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and cook without stirring for about 2-3 minutes, or until the edges start to set.</li>
                <li>Gently lift the edges of the omelette with a spatula, allowing the uncooked egg to flow underneath. Continue to cook until the omelette is just set but still slightly soft in the center, about another 1-2 minutes.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Add the fillings and fold:
            <ul>
                <li>Spoon the whipped cream and mixed berries onto one half of the omelette.</li>
                <li>Carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the fillings using a spatula.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Finish and serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate.</li>
                <li>Dust with powdered sugar and garnish with fresh mint leaves, if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
            </ul></li>
