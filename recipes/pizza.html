    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Prepare the dough:
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Preheat the oven:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Shape the dough:
            <ul>
                <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal parts (for two pizzas) or keep it whole for one large pizza.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Assemble the pizza:
            <ul>
                <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Arrange the salami slices on top of the cheese.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle oregano, basil, and garlic powder (if using) over the toppings.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Bake the pizza:
            <ul>
                <li>If using a pizza stone, slide the pizza onto the preheated stone. Otherwise, place the baking sheet in the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>Finish and serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes.</li>
                <li>Brush the crust with a little olive oil for extra flavor and shine.</li>
                <li>Slice and enjoy!</li>
            </ul></li>  
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your homemade salami pizza!</p>
